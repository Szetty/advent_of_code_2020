# Advent of Code 2020

This year I have chosen Rust to implement the advent of code puzzles.

## Running the code

Running a given day:

```sh
cargo run $DAY_NR
```

Running tests (some days may have unit tests):
```sh
cargo test
```

## Observations

Solutions that can probably be optimized for time performance: 11, 15, 17.
